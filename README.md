## Introduction to Mathematical Operators in Python

Welcome to this lesson on mathematical operators in Python! In this chapter, we'll explore
the fundamental mathematical operations you can perform in Python. These operators are
essential for any kind of numerical computation, from simple arithmetic to complex
calculations.

We'll cover the following operators:

### 1. Addition (+)

### 2. Subtraction (-)

### 3. Multiplication (\*)

### 4. Division (/)

### 5. Modulus (%)

### 6. Exponentiation (\*\*)

### 7. Floor Division (//)

Each operator will be explained with examples. Feel free to modify the numbers in the
examples to see how the results change! And run python3 -m unittest test.py to check the results!
